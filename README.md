# Material for VSC Handson sessions for AI4MI

## Information

Within this repository you will find the material for the Artificial Intelligence for Materials Industry hands-on session given at the [Flemish Supercomputer Center (VSC)](https://www.vscentrum.be). The hands-on session comes in the form of two presentations with accompanying examples and exercises in jupyter notebooks. These follow the first two cases of the [Artificial Intelligence for Materials industry](https://ai4mi.epotentia.com) course.

The first case study covers the classification of steel defects using machine learning based on typical spreadsheet data. We learn how to analyze data train and optimize models and useand explainable AI to gain insight into the inner workings of the models.

The second case study repeats the defect classification exercise but uses deep learning to immediately classify the raw image data without first creating tabular input features. We learn how to prepare data for image deep learning, train and optimize a classification model, examine how to make it more robust and see if we can interpret how our final model makes its prediction with explainable AI.

## Data

The datasets included within this repository were duplicated for ease of use. When used please attribute the original sources:

- [Semeion steel plate faults dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Steel+Plates+Faults)
- [NEU surface dafect database](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/songkechen/zh_CN/zhym/263269/list/index.htm)

## Accreditation

The hands-on session was developed by [ePotentia](https://www.epotentia.com) in collaboration with the VSC. The project was funded by the [Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)](https://www.fwo.be/). A full video course is available accompanying this material on the [Artificial Intelligence for Materials industry](https://ai4mi.epotentia.com) course site. The course was developed by [ePotentia](https://www.epotentia.com), [UGent](https://www.ugent.be) and [OCAS](https://www.ocas.be) with input from [Umicore](https://www.umicore.be) and [Agfa](https://www.agfa.be). The original course was funded by the [European Social Fund](https://esf-vlaanderen.be) and the [Flemish Cofinancing Fund (VCF)](https://www.vlaio.be/).
